# Flickr Fixr

A browser extension to enhance the Flickr experience in your desktop web-browser.

Show photographer's albums on photostream-pages, Control speed of slideshows, Photographer's other photos by tag-links, Links to album-map and album-comments, Actually show a geotagged photo on the associated map (or on Google Maps!), Top-pagination, Newsfeed detection - _And more!..._

Available as a browser extension or as an userscript. Currently features of browser extension and userscript are almost the same, but browser extension is my primary focus going forward, and the recommended way to install Flickr Fixr.

Install the _Flickr Fixr_ browser extension:
* [Mozilla Firefox Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/flickr-fixr?src=external-github) - Also installs and works in other Firefox based browsers like f.ex. Waterfox and Tor.  
* [Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flickr-fixr/ledhkkpililplmmfcfnhkgifmcnboonb) - Also installs and works in many other Chromium based browsers.
* [Microsoft Edge Addons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ieinimkepkfmmpeakdgnoikimokffneh) - For the new Chromium-based version of Edge.

If for some reason you prefer using the userscript version, you can install it via [via GreaseFork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/12008-stig-s-flickr-fixr). Installing the userscript requires Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey or similar extension installed first for userscript support in the webbrowser.

Most detailed feature description can currently be found in the Flickr Hacks forum: https://www.flickr.com/groups/96035807@N00/discuss/72157655601688753/

The browser extension is "cross-browser compatible". It is the exact [same plugin (zip-file)](https://github.com/StigNygaard/Stigs_Flickr_Fixr/releases) distributed for Firefox, Chrome and Edge. To create a browser extension from repository, simply zip content of WebExtension folder. For easy cross-browser compatibility, Flickr Fixr is using [browser-polyfill.js](https://github.com/StigNygaard/Stigs_Flickr_Fixr/tree/master/WebExtension/lib/mozilla) from Mozilla's [MPL 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StigNygaard/Stigs_Flickr_Fixr/master/WebExtension/lib/mozilla/LICENSE) licensed [webextension-polyfill project](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill).
