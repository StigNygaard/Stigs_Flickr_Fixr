To create a browser extension from a branch in this repository, simply zip the content of WebExtension folder.
Normally Flickr Fixr is a "cross-browser compatible" extension with the exact
[same plug-in (zip-file)](https://github.com/StigNygaard/Stigs_Flickr_Fixr/releases) distributed for Firefox, Chrome
and Edge. However, in the period of transition from "Manifest version 2"- to "Manifest version 3"-type of webextensions,
browser extensions for Firefox- and Chromium-based browsers will be created from different branches. There are now a
[branch for the deprecated "MV2 type" webextension](https://github.com/StigNygaard/Stigs_Flickr_Fixr/tree/manifest2-legacy).
The [master-branch](https://github.com/StigNygaard/Stigs_Flickr_Fixr/tree/master) is for "MV3 with background service
worker" extensions (currently supported by Chromium browsers) and I might also make a branch for "MV3 with background
page" extensions (supported by Firefox 109+). When Mozilla has implemented
[support for "background service workers" in Firefox webextensions](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1573659),
I expect to go back to make true "cross-browser compatible" releases from the master-branch only again.
