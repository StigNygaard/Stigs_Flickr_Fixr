The browser extension is "cross-browser compatible". It is the exact

Chrome and Edge. To create a browser extension from repository, simply zip content of WebExtension folder.
For easy cross-browser compatibility, Flickr Fixr is using
[browser-polyfill.js](https://github.com/StigNygaard/Stigs_Flickr_Fixr/tree/master/WebExtension/lib/mozilla) from
Mozilla's [MPL 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StigNygaard/Stigs_Flickr_Fixr/master/WebExtension/lib/mozilla/LICENSE)
licensed [webextension-polyfill project](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill).
