Privacy Policy for the Flickr Fixr browser-extension

Flickr Fixr adds or changes look and functionality of Flickr pages, by rearranging, modifying and sometimes also
by adding extra content fetched from another Flickr page or Flickr service.

Flickr Fixr does not collect or share data about its use, users or usersâ€™ systems. But any activity on Flickr
sites and services can be monitored and logged by Flickr itself.

Current version of Flickr Fixr is not communicating with any 3rd party (non-Flickr) services, but if some future
feature of Flickr Fixr requires communication with a 3rd-party service, it will be an opt-in (default disabled)
feature. Which and how data might be shared by enabling such a feature, will be clearly described.
