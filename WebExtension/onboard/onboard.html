  <h1>Congratulations!...</h1>

  <p>You have just installed or updated to <i>Flickr Fixr version <span id="verstr"></span></i>.
    If you have any open Flickr-pages already, you usually need to reload pages to make install/update take effect on these.</p>

  <p>If you are new to Flickr Fixr, make sure to look through features on the <a href="#" class="settings">Options Page</a>.</p>

  <h2>New in this version...</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Photopage "Show in Photostream" links</strong><br/>
      <img src="/options/PhotostreamLink-326x47.gif" alt="" />
      This is actually a feature I have been thinking about implementing ever since first version of Flickr Fixr
      debuted back in 2015(!). But for some reason it took me 9 years to do it ðŸ™„<br/>
      On Photopages, this makes it always possible to open <em>Photostream where the photo is located</em>. No
      matter if your current Photopage was opened from a group pool, an album, a search result, a faves-list,
      Explore-page, gallery, etc. The new link is shown in upper left corner as an arrow next to the other arrow
      that brings you back to the "context" you came from.<br/>
      I find this feature very useful when I want to explore more from a photographer from same period, and I regret
      I haven't implemented this 9 years ago. I think it brings a bit of much needed "gamification" value back
      to Flickr. I have already had great fun finding interesting photos and photostreams while testing this ðŸ™‚
    </li>
    <li><strong>A single cross-browser MV3-extension</strong><br/>
      After a period of maintaining separate versions of Flickr Fixr for Chromium (Chrome and Edge) and Firefox
      browsers, recent updates to the browsers' Manifest V3 support (a to some extent standardized model for browser
      extensions) has made it possible to (once again) make <em>only one</em> cross-browser extension that works in
      all the browsers. Convenient, but good for you? Well, at least easier maintaining for me ðŸ™‚<br/>
      To achieve this, I have had to raise the minimum browser-versions requirements, which is now Firefox 128 or
      Chrome/Edge 121.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can always enable and disable features on the <a href="#" class="settings">Options Page</a> if you don't
    like everything that Flickr Fixr can do. Some features also have extra settings to tune the functionality.</p>

  <h2>Help, information, feedback?...</h2>
  <p>Visit the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/flickrhacks/discuss/72157655601688753/" target="_blank">Flickr Fixr thread</a> in Flickr Hacks forum. I regularly watch that thread for new comments.</p>

  <p>I hope you enjoy Flickr even more with Flickr Fixr...</p>
