  <h1>Congratulations!...</h1>

  <p>You have just installed or updated to <i>Flickr Fixr version <span id="verstr"></span></i>.
    If you have any open Flickr-pages already, you usually need to reload pages to make install/update take effect on these.</p>

  <p>If you are new to Flickr Fixr, make sure to look through features on the <a href="#" class="settings">Options Page</a>.</p>

  <h2>New in this version...</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Just a small update to adapt Flickr Fixr functionality to the new album pages. The "album comments" and
      "map view" links inserted by Flickr Fixr, are now shown next to photo and view counts of the album. Maybe
      not an extremely intuitive place to locate the "map view" link(?). But for now, it was a quick fix to bring
      back both links after the changes Flickr has made to the album pages.<br />
      PS. If somebody gets confused by the "album comments" link, it was an official feature of Flickr many many
      years ago. The old page that the link points to, makes it possible to see comments made in those old days.
      And actually I think it is still possible to make new comments, but be aware that most people won't see themðŸ™„
    </li>

  </ul>

  <p>You can always enable and disable features on the <a href="#" class="settings">Options Page</a> if you don't
    like everything that Flickr Fixr can do. Some features also have extra settings to tune the functionality.</p>

  <h2>Help, information, feedback?...</h2>
  <p>Visit the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/flickrhacks/discuss/72157655601688753/" target="_blank">Flickr Fixr thread</a> in Flickr Hacks forum. I regularly watch that thread for new comments.</p>

  <p>I hope you enjoy Flickr even more with Flickr Fixr...</p>
