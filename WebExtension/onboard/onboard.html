  <h1>Congratulations!...</h1>

  <p>You have just installed or updated to <i>Flickr Fixr version <span id="verstr"></span></i>.
    If you have any open Flickr-pages already, you usually need to reload pages to make install/update take effect on these.</p>

  <p>If you are new to Flickr Fixr, make sure to look through features on the <a href="#" class="settings">Options Page</a>.</p>

  <h2>This is a special <em>Edge version</em></h2>

  <p>Standards and cross-browser designs are something I care a lot about and always try to support. That's why
    Flickr Fixr generally is made so I can publish the exact same extension version for Firefox, Chrome and Edge
    browsers. However, lately Microsoft's Add-ons site hasn't allowed me to upload the "normal" version of my
    extension that is available for Firefox and Chrome. It
    <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/MicrosoftEdge-Extensions/issues/172" target="_blank">sounds like Microsoft acknowledge the problem and plan to fix it</a>.
    But after three months of waiting, nothing has happened yet.
  </p>
  <p>You Edge users has missed a couple of updates to Flickr Fixr, so I decided this time to publish a special tailored
    Edge version. It probably won't happen with all updates of Flickr Fixr, so going forward you could consider
    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flickr-fixr/ledhkkpililplmmfcfnhkgifmcnboonb" target="_blank">installing Flickr Fixr from Chrome Add-ons webstore instead</a>,
    which Edge also supports installing extensions from. But hopefully Microsoft will fix the problem soon.
  </p>

  <h3>New from previous version that was available for Edge, is:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Photopage "Show in Photostream" links</strong><br/>
      <img src="/options/PhotostreamLink-326x47.gif" alt="" />
      On Photopages, this feature makes it always possible to open <em>Photostream where the photo is located</em>.
      No matter if your current Photopage was opened from a group pool, an album, a search result, a faves-list,
      Explore-page, gallery, etc. The new link is shown in upper left corner as an arrow next to the other arrow
      that brings you back to the "context" you came from.<br/>
      This is actually a feature I have been thinking about implementing ever since first version of Flickr Fixr
      debuted back in 2015(!). But for some reason it took me 9 years to do it ðŸ™„
    </li>
    <li><strong>Fix: Adapting to the new album-headers on Flickr</strong><br/>
      The "album comments" and "map view" links are once again inserted by Flickr Fixr in the header of album pages.
      Links are shown next to the photo and view counts of the album.<br />
      PS. If somebody gets confused by the "album comments" link, it was an official feature of Flickr many many
      years ago. The old page that the link points to, makes it possible to see comments made in those old days.
      And actually I think it is still possible to make new comments, but be aware that most people won't see themðŸ™„
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can always enable and disable features on the <a href="#" class="settings">Options Page</a> if you don't
    like everything that Flickr Fixr can do. Some features also have extra settings to tune the functionality.</p>

  <h2>Help, information, feedback?...</h2>
  <p>Visit the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/flickrhacks/discuss/72157655601688753/" target="_blank">Flickr Fixr thread</a> in Flickr Hacks forum. I regularly watch that thread for new comments.</p>

  <p>I hope you enjoy Flickr even more with Flickr Fixr...</p>
