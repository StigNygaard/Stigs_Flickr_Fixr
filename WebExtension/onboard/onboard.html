  <h1>Congratulations!...</h1>

  <p>You have just installed or updated to Flickr Fixr version <span id="verstr"></span>. If you have any open Flickr-pages already, you need to reload pages to make install/update take effect on these.</p>

  <p>If you are new to Flickr Fixr, make sure to look through features on the <a href="#" id="settings">Options Page</a>.</p>

  <h2>This version <em>removes</em> the upscaling feature!</h2>

  <p>The upscaling feature was one of the main reasons I originally created Flickr Fixr back in 2015. However, since SmugMug in 2018 introduced larger display versions and included
    photos pre-dating 2012 for this (which until then had been limited to max 1024px size), the feature have felt less important. The code was also old, ugly, complex and "sensitive"
    (very vulnerable to site-changes) and have been malfunctioning a lot lately. So since my motivation to spend more time on that feature has also disappeared, I feel it is time to
    say... <em>goodbye!</em> I will spend my future energy on other features (or on bugfixesðŸ˜‰) instead...
  </p>

  <p>As always, any feedback can be given in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/flickrhacks/discuss/72157655601688753/" target="_blank">the Flickr Fixr thread in Flickr Hacks forum</a>.
    I regularly watch that thread for comments.</p>

  <p>I hope you enjoy Flickr even more with Flickr Fixr...</p>
